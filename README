# README
In order to help reviewing this assignment I will add brief explanations - if necessary - for each commit. 

## Usage
Add a .env file and add USER_AGENT={your-user-agent-value}
Run "npm i" and you can run the tests

## Commits explained
Commit message: "Initial commit - project setup"
Extra info: 
I. Playwright project initiated as explained in the Docs 
II. Added a .env (so that user agent will never be shared on GitHub)
III. Added .gitignore file
IV. Added README file

Commit message: First smoke test - most crucial HTML elements
Extra info: The first smoke test should be a check if the most crucial HTML elements are loaded. I limited the expects to 10 (because it is good practice to check 5 to 10 things per test). 

Commit message: Thinking about four other smoke tests
Extra info: After checking for crucial HTML elements it is time to identify the most crucial paths for the fuda.nl application. I thought of the following: 
    - search results for buying sanity checks
    - user login sanity checks
    - makelaar login sanity checks
    - one-remaining... (which I need to think of)
I will take a 30 minutes brake and walk the dog and after that I will continue
